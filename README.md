NLP-Driven Emergency Call Processing for Automated FIR Generation

An AI-powered system that automates the generation of First Information Reports (FIRs) from emergency calls using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and acoustic analysis. This project leverages modern deep learning and speech processing techniques to extract actionable insights, assess emergency severity, and streamline response prioritization.

Features

- **Entity Extraction**: Uses NLP (spaCy, BERT) to identify key incident details such as location, individuals involved, and incident type.
- **Acoustic Emotion Detection**: Applies MFCC and emotion classification models to assess caller stress and urgency.
- **Emergency Severity Scoring**: Calculates a severity score to classify and prioritize emergency incidents.
- **Automated FIR Generation**: Drafts structured FIRs automatically and dispatches them to appropriate authorities.
- **Improved Decision Accuracy**: Enhances transparency and accountability with legally-structured documentation.
